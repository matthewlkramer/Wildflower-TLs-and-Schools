# Testing Progress Log

## Current Test: TEST SCHOOL - Debug Testing

### Issue #1: Test School Not Visible in UI
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved - School exists but wasn't showing in list
**Created**: Via API at 2025-07-11T15:54:52.000Z
**ID**: recET7shK7qloVb57

### Issue #2: 404 Error on School Detail Page
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved - Route is `/school/:id` not `/schools/:id`
**URL**: /schools/recGFQgorvjHxzXc3 (incorrect) ‚Üí /school/recGFQgorvjHxzXc3 (correct)
**Error**: "404 page not found" when navigating to test school detail page

#### Debug Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Verified both test schools exist in API (recET7shK7qloVb57 and recGFQgorvjHxzXc3)
2. ‚úÖ API endpoint /api/schools/:id works correctly
3. ‚úÖ Found frontend route is `/school/:id` (singular) not `/schools/:id` (plural)

#### Debug Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Confirmed school created successfully via API
2. ‚úÖ Verified school exists in API response (282 schools total)
3. ‚úÖ School has status "Visioning" (not "Planning")
4. ‚è≥ Need to check if filtering by status is hiding the school
5. ‚è≥ Need to verify search functionality

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- API shows school exists with status "Visioning"
- Need to check if UI has default filters applied
- Need to test search box functionality

## Testing Approach Improvements

### Enhanced Debugging Methodology

1. **Automated Action Simulation**
   - Created test-ui-action.js script for simulating user actions
   - Can trigger API calls that mimic button clicks
   - Logs results for analysis

2. **Visual Verification Process**
   - Take baseline screenshot before action
   - Execute action via API
   - Wait for UI update (2-3 seconds)
   - Take follow-up screenshot
   - Compare expected vs actual

3. **Data Consistency Checks**
   - Verify API response data
   - Check if UI displays match API data
   - Monitor console for errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests

4. **Systematic Test Matrix**
   - Created comprehensive test plan for all tabs
   - Each interactive element has test case
   - Track status: ‚è≥ Pending, ‚úÖ Pass, ‚ùå Fail

### Test School: TEST SCHOOL (recGFQgorvjHxzXc3)
