# Testing Progress Log

## Completed Tests ‚úÖ

### School Creation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Test**: Created "test test" school via Add School modal
- **Result**: Successfully created record ID "recUh88gXDg00QU4T" in Airtable
- **Fields Tested**: Name, Short Name, Governance Model, School Email, School Phone, Website, Membership Status
- **Issues Fixed**: 
  - Corrected Airtable field mappings (Email‚ÜíSchool Email, Phone‚ÜíSchool Phone)
  - Updated membership status options to match actual Airtable values
  - Removed problematic SSJ Target City/State fields

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### Data Synchronization - FIXED
- **Issue**: Test schools not appearing in frontend after creation
- **Root Cause**: AG Grid Enterprise SetFilter incompatible with Community edition
- **Solution**: Replaced all `agSetColumnFilter` with `agTextColumnFilter`, fixed rowSelection deprecation warnings
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Both test schools visible, search working perfectly

### Sorting Bug - FIXED
- **Issue**: Test schools appearing at end of list despite alphabetical names
- **Root Cause**: Case-sensitive sorting puts lowercase "test" after uppercase names
- **Solution**: Added case-insensitive comparator functions to all text columns
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Schools now sort alphabetically regardless of case

### Delete Authorization - BLOCKED
- **Issue**: DELETE operations fail with "NOT_AUTHORIZED" error from Airtable
- **Root Cause**: Airtable account lacks delete permissions on Schools table
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Cannot test delete functionality due to Airtable permissions
