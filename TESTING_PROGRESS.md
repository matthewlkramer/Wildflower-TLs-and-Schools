# Testing Progress Log

## Completed Tests ‚úÖ

### School Creation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### Data Synchronization - FIXED
- **Issue**: Test schools not appearing in frontend after creation
- **Root Cause**: AG Grid Enterprise SetFilter incompatible with Community edition
- **Solution**: Replaced all `agSetColumnFilter` with `agTextColumnFilter`, fixed rowSelection deprecation warnings
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Both test schools visible, search working perfectly

### Sorting Bug - FIXED
- **Issue**: Test schools appearing at end of list despite alphabetical names

- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Schools now sort alphabetically regardless of case

### Delete Authorization - BLOCKED
- **Issue**: DELETE operations fail with "NOT_AUTHORIZED" error from Airtable
- **Root Cause**: Airtable account lacks delete permissions on Schools table
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Cannot test delete functionality due to Airtable permissions
