# Testing Progress Log

## Current Test: TEST SCHOOL - Debug Testing

### Issue #1: Test School Not Visible in UI
**Status**: 🔍 Debugging
**Created**: Via API at 2025-07-11T15:54:52.000Z
**ID**: recET7shK7qloVb57

#### Debug Steps:
1. ✅ Confirmed school created successfully via API
2. ✅ Verified school exists in API response (282 schools total)
3. ✅ School has status "Visioning" (not "Planning")
4. ⏳ Need to check if filtering by status is hiding the school
5. ⏳ Need to verify search functionality

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- API shows school exists with status "Visioning"
- Need to check if UI has default filters applied
- Need to test search box functionality

## Testing Approach Improvements

### Enhanced Debugging Methodology

1. **Automated Action Simulation**
   - Created test-ui-action.js script for simulating user actions
   - Can trigger API calls that mimic button clicks
   - Logs results for analysis

2. **Visual Verification Process**
   - Take baseline screenshot before action
   - Execute action via API
   - Wait for UI update (2-3 seconds)
   - Take follow-up screenshot
   - Compare expected vs actual

3. **Data Consistency Checks**
   - Verify API response data
   - Check if UI displays match API data
   - Monitor console for errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests

4. **Systematic Test Matrix**
   - Created comprehensive test plan for all tabs
   - Each interactive element has test case
   - Track status: ⏳ Pending, ✅ Pass, ❌ Fail

### Next Steps:
1. Navigate directly to test school URL: /schools/recET7shK7qloVb57
2. If accessible, begin systematic tab testing
3. If not accessible, debug why school detail page won't load
4. Document all findings in this progress log
